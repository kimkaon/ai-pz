{"input_text": "What is the big bang theory?", "target_text": "The big bang theory explains that the universe began from an extremely hot, dense state about 13.8 billion years ago and has been expanding ever since."}
{"input_text": "How does photosynthesis work?", "target_text": "Photosynthesis is the process where plants use sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to create glucose and oxygen, converting light energy into chemical energy."}
{"input_text": "What is artificial neural networks?", "target_text": "Artificial neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks, used in machine learning to recognize patterns and make decisions."}
{"input_text": "How does the immune system work?", "target_text": "The immune system protects the body by recognizing and fighting foreign substances through white blood cells, antibodies, and other defense mechanisms."}
{"input_text": "What is renewable energy?", "target_text": "Renewable energy comes from natural sources that replenish themselves, such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power."}
{"input_text": "How do vaccines work?", "target_text": "Vaccines work by introducing a weakened or inactive form of a pathogen to train the immune system to recognize and fight the actual disease."}
{"input_text": "What is climate change?", "target_text": "Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns, primarily caused by human activities increasing greenhouse gases."}
{"input_text": "How does DNA replication work?", "target_text": "DNA replication is the process where DNA makes an exact copy of itself during cell division, ensuring genetic information is passed to new cells."}
{"input_text": "What is the theory of evolution?", "target_text": "The theory of evolution explains how species change over time through natural selection, where favorable traits increase survival and reproduction."}
{"input_text": "How does the brain process information?", "target_text": "The brain processes information through networks of neurons that communicate via electrical and chemical signals, forming thoughts and memories."}
{"input_text": "What is genetic engineering?", "target_text": "Genetic engineering is the direct manipulation of an organism's genes using biotechnology to modify characteristics or introduce new traits."}
{"input_text": "How do earthquakes occur?", "target_text": "Earthquakes occur when tectonic plates move and release energy along fault lines, causing the ground to shake and potentially causing damage."}
{"input_text": "What is biodiversity?", "target_text": "Biodiversity refers to the variety of life on Earth, including different species, genetic variations, and ecosystems that support all living things."}
{"input_text": "How does the heart pump blood?", "target_text": "The heart pumps blood through a four-chambered system, using electrical signals to coordinate contractions that push blood throughout the body."}
{"input_text": "What is machine learning?", "target_text": "Machine learning is a subset of AI where computers learn to recognize patterns and make predictions from data without being explicitly programmed."}
{"input_text": "How do muscles contract?", "target_text": "Muscles contract when actin and myosin filaments slide past each other, triggered by calcium release and ATP energy in response to nerve signals."}
{"input_text": "What is nanotechnology?", "target_text": "Nanotechnology involves manipulating matter at the atomic and molecular scale to create materials and devices with novel properties and applications."}
{"input_text": "How does memory work?", "target_text": "Memory works through neural pathways that encode, store, and retrieve information, involving different brain regions for short-term and long-term memory."}
{"input_text": "What is biotechnology?", "target_text": "Biotechnology uses living organisms or biological systems to develop products and technologies that improve human life and the environment."}
{"input_text": "How do lungs function?", "target_text": "Lungs function by exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide through tiny air sacs called alveoli, where gas exchange occurs with the bloodstream."}
{"input_text": "What is sustainable development?", "target_text": "Sustainable development meets present needs without compromising future generations' ability to meet their own needs, balancing economy, environment, and society."}
{"input_text": "How does the digestive system work?", "target_text": "The digestive system breaks down food into nutrients through mechanical and chemical processes, absorbing nutrients and eliminating waste."}
{"input_text": "What is ecology?", "target_text": "Ecology is the study of interactions between organisms and their environment, including relationships between species and ecosystem dynamics."}
{"input_text": "How do hormones work?", "target_text": "Hormones are chemical messengers produced by glands that travel through the bloodstream to regulate various body functions and processes."}
{"input_text": "What is conservation biology?", "target_text": "Conservation biology focuses on protecting and preserving biodiversity, endangered species, and ecosystems from human impacts and environmental threats."}
{"input_text": "How do neurons communicate?", "target_text": "Neurons communicate through electrical impulses and chemical signals called neurotransmitters that cross synapses between nerve cells."}
{"input_text": "What is oceanography?", "target_text": "Oceanography is the study of oceans, including their physical, chemical, biological, and geological characteristics and processes."}
{"input_text": "How does reproduction work?", "target_text": "Reproduction involves the production of offspring through sexual or asexual processes, ensuring the continuation of species through genetic material transfer."}
